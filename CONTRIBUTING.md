# Contributing

**Everyone** is free to contribute, issues and pull requests are **always** :handshake: welcome.


##  Issues

If you found a :ant: **bug** or want to suggest a :rocket: **new feature**, open an issue:

- Ensure that it is **not a duplicate** of an existing issue
- **Fill the issue template** providing more informations as possible.


### Bugs policy

I adopt a :no_entry_sign: **"Zero Bug Policy"** for the following reasons:

- I like to ship :sparkles: **high-quality code**.
- I'm the first :nerd_face: end-user of my own libraries. 
- Managing a lot of bug issues can quickly become a :exploding_head: problem, especially maintaining [many libraries](https://github.com/fabiocaccamo?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers).


### New Features policy

Considering that this is Open Source and not "free-code on demand", I work on new features only if/when:

- I **need** them directly on :computer: work projects.
- I'm :moneybag: **paid/sponsored** for a specific feature.


## Pull Requests

Good :leftwards_arrow_with_hook: pull requests are appreciated and I review them as soon as I can.

Please, avoid wasting my :stopwatch: free time by complying these simple requests:

- Don't submit a PR that doesn't refer to an :dart: issue.
- Mark the PR as :ok_hand: **"ready for review"** only when it is complete and the :green_circle: CI pass.


## Priorities

You can :eyes: see my **Open Source projects TODO** list/priorities [here](https://github.com/users/fabiocaccamo/projects/6/views/1).
