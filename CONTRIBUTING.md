# Contributing

**Everyone** is free to contribute, detailed issues and good quality pull requests are **always** :handshake: appreciated.


##  Issues

If you found a :ant: **bug** or want to suggest a :rocket: **new feature**, open an issue:

- Ensure that it is **not a duplicate** of an existing issue
- **Fill the issue template** providing more informations as possible.


### Bugs policy

I adopt a :no_entry_sign: **"Zero Bug Policy"** for the following reasons:

- I like to ship :sparkles: **high-quality code**.
- I'm the first :nerd_face: end-user of my own libraries. 
- Managing a lot of bug issues can quickly become a :exploding_head: problem, especially maintaining [many libraries](https://github.com/fabiocaccamo?tab=repositories&q=&type=source&language=&sort=stargazers).


### New Features policy

Considering that this is Open Source and not "free-code on demand", I work on new features only if/when:

- I **need** them directly on :computer: work projects.
- I'm :moneybag: **paid/sponsored** for a specific feature.


## Pull Requests

I review PRs as soon as I can, please follow these steps for submitting good quality PRs:

- **Open a issue** (if it doesn't exist yet) for the PR you intend to submit.
- Changes should be **covered by tests** to avoid regressions in the :crystal_ball: future.
- **Update the :globe_with_meridians: translations** files if the project has some.
- **Run :test_tube: tests** ensuring that there are no errors.
- **Submit a pull-request** referencing the related issue and mark it as :ok_hand: **"Ready for review"** only if it :green_circle: passes the `CI`.


## Priorities

You can :eyes: see my **Open Source projects TODO** list/priorities [here](https://github.com/users/fabiocaccamo/projects/6/views/1).
